# CS441_SpeechToText

IOS Version of Assignment 5 for CS441 - Binghamton University

Ugurcan Demir

# Homework : 

On both iOS and Android, there are all sorts of interesting APIs for cool things.  Gyroscopes.  Accelerometers.  Cameras and video. Sound generation. Text to speech.  Speech to text. Web interfaces. VR. AR. QR codes. Maps and GPS.

For program 5, pick something that you find interesting, and build an app that uses it.  You'll need to Google around a bit to find out how things work, read the manual pages and documentation, look at some tutorials, and think of
clever ideas of your own.  The mobile app platforms are like the big box of the coolest Lego you can imagine; build something!  On Friday, we'll have code review again -- make something that you think someone else would say "oh, that's cool" about.

# The application idea : 

  I made an app that you can translate speech into text and text into speech.
